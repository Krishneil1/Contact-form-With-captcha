Contact form with Captcha
Contact form built suing the following technologies:

->PHP
->HTML5
->Bootstrap
->JavaScrpit/Jquery

This is a simple contact form built using the above tech. As with all present  web pages, people need to interact with their clients. I have built this simple Contact form with basic security features using bootstrap.

This is a simple implementation of Captcha using javaScprit/JQuery. The user has to input the correct value for the addition. The total addition will always be less than 20 and both numbers (first and second value) will not be greater than 10.

Of course, this is not the world's best spam protection but it's a simple implementation and you can build on this. Google provides better catch solutions so its worth having a look at Google's reCAPTCHA https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/start
